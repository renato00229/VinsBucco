/**
 * Air Hockey Revisited, Single Player game.
 * The idea was born from Air Hokey: a game in which two or more players compete to score many points
 * as possible with the help of paddles. The paddle runs on the plane as if it were on ice, making
 * the game exciting and fun. The aim of the game is to get the ball into your goal, moving it with your
 * paddle.
 *
 * This Game was designed as a single player, so as to move the paddle with the mouse, by including
 * several difficulties.
 *
 * @Login #java class
 * When the game begins, you can login to store your score and then pick up where you left off!
 *
 * @Paddle #java class
 * Clicking with the mouse on the paddle, you can move it to make it go to hit the ball and that it
 * ends up in the goal
 *
 * @Goal #java class
 * if your ball goes to the goal, your score is increased by 1
